      Practices to Using the Web Safely:
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <a href="https://us.norton.com/security_response/browsewebsafely.jsp" target="_blank">Visit Norton.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The website linked above helps determine if a website is safe or not and how to properly "surf" the web. When trying 
          to go to another browser, type the address in rather than following the link. Do NOT put out
          personal information if you do not trust the website - make sure it is secure. Many "free" programs
          that one may install off the web can come linked with viruses or tracking devices.

        </p>
        <p>
          Tip number one: always keep your browser software up to date as well as other software like for your operating system.
          Running anti-virus software will provide protection for you and your computer removing malicious files and sites.
          There are all different types of anti-virus software to purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important tip is to change your password frequently. No, not every week, but maybe every month or two.
          Reusing passwords for multiple sites especially makes you an easy target. 
          Browse carefully!

        </p>
        <p>
          Spyware is everywhere! It is even where you least expect it; and probably where you frequent often!
          When you visit a site and you begin to browse and a pop-up appears, and you click on it.... that could be dangerous.
          Malicious spyware are linked everywhere. A clickable graphic could even contain spyware. 
          Spyware can easily be loaded onto your laptop without you even knowing. 
          What comes next could be disastrous - your personal information could be stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that being said, use sites that are secure. Do not click on any pop-ups or ads.
          Get anti-spyware installed as soon as possible! Its for the safety of your own personal information and your computer.
